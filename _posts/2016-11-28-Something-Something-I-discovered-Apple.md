There's a lot of hate around Apple products lately, I also don't particularly like some changes that are occurring in recent devices. Although something I hate more than everything else, is how - even if one day they start making the worst devices ever - I will still stick to my Apple products.

Why? I'm probably very dumb, but that's not the only reason.

What is the most powerful feature of Apple is *the ecosystem*. I'm not talking about macOS, iOS, or watchOS. But how they have always tried since the introduction of iCloud, to connect all their devices together to make all your different devices become one.

That struck me even more today when I entered in a coffee shop I'd never been before, and asked for the wi-fi password - there were only password-protected access points. I took out my MacBook to work in that coffee shop as the perfect hipster I am, and connected to the wi-fi network. Worked for a while and took a look at my iPhone, and then I noticed on the phone: it was connected to the wi-fi. How did it know how to connect? Because the Mac sent the infos on iCloud. My phone got the info on iCloud using the LTE network, and connected to the wi-fi because had a good signal. What I had to do? Nothing. Did they ever advertise this specific feature? Not that I'm aware of, but it's part of their "Continuity" effort I believe. And it is composed of so much things like this one simple example I just gave, little things, building up to make your experience better, without you even knowing it.

That's the thing I'm interested in the most. It always goes the extra mile to make your experience as good as possible. And that's only **truly** possible because they have control over everything: the software, the hardware, the cloud. You can only see this value when you use the ecosystem and not only one or 2 isolated devices, that's where it makes it the most powerful but that's what is the most annoying to me on another hand.

Now there's not much other companies I could see being able to do all that as they do, the only one I see is Google. But whether I'm victim of a marketing lie or not, I trust my every day data, my daily habits, my every move, more into the hands of Apple than Google.

Next stop will be an Apple TV but only when they decided to support 4K HDMI.
