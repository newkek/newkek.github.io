Yeah, my bones lost some weight, I switched to the Skinny Bones theme for Jekyll. That looks good, still need to figure out some things though. But apparently there are some pretty cool features.

One bummer is that default's posts layout include a 'teaser' image in the Articles grid, and it actually forces you to add an image. A bit annoying but I must admit the grid looks good. And it can take gifs ! ❤️
